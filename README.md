# RADPWA

Experiment to building a UI using Rapid Application Development techniques.

By using visual and non-visual component libraries, you can quickly compose user interfaces and common user interactions of project tasks.

This project adds a layer of code execution. Normally code gets executed during the compilation process, and after that run-time.
With this approach, the source code gets created in a composition process.

## Approach

Use a 'transformer' that can transform a UI Definition (.json file) into application code (React)

Expose components for a command pallette from libraries, compose a UI, compile these definitions into a working application with custom logic.

Take into account nesting, props, data-types.

Try to build the studio application using its own RAD Compiler :-)
